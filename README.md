## Installation && Running the app

```bash

$ cd client && npm install
$ cd ..
$ npm run app
```

## Challenges I faced

1-Compatibility Issues: Most of the charts libraries like React-chartjs-2, Victory and Nivo does not support react v18 yet. Therefore, I used recharts.
It elaborates the required concepts, but lacks the wow effect as its charts are limited in shapes, despite the customization features they provide. I could have rolled back to v16 or v15 but it would indicate outdated concepts and implementations

## Comments

For the purpose of running the project I left the .env file out of the gitignore list.
